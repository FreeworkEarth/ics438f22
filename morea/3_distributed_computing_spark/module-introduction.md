In this module, we briefly introduce the map reduce paradigm and focus on Spark, one of the most commonly used map and reduce-based distributed systems for handling massive amounts of data.
This module covered Spark's main components and how data is stored and optimized in Spark and emphasizes functions to load, explore, manipulate, and join data in Spark.
